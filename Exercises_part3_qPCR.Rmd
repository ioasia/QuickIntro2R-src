## Introduction

This report analyzes a qPCR dataset (`ex1`) containing sample groups (Control and Treatment), concentrations, and ΔCt values. The goal is to:
- Compare ΔCt values between the Control and Treatment groups.
- Visualize the distributions.
- Compile a reproducible analysis.

---

## Step 1: Load and Explore the Data
```{r load-data, echo=TRUE}
### Load data 
ex1 <- read.table('proj/Data/qPCR.txt',header=TRUE, stringsAsFactors = TRUE)


### Structure of the Data
# Check structure and first few rows of the dataset
str(ex1)
head(ex1)
summary(ex1)
```


## Step 2: Calculate mean and standard deviation per group

```{r mean-sd, echo=TRUE}
#install.packages(dplyr)
library(dplyr)

# Group statistics
group_stats <- ex1 %>%
  group_by(Sample) %>%
  summarise(
    Mean_Delta_Ct = mean(DeltaCt, na.rm = TRUE),
    SD_Delta_Ct = sd(DeltaCt, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
print(group_stats)

# Perform a t-test
wilcoxon_test <- wilcox.test(DeltaCt ~ Sample, data = ex1)
print(wilcoxon_test)
```
## Step 3: Visualize groups deltaCt

```{r plot, echo=TRUE}

# Load ggplot2 for visualization
# install.packages(ggplot2)
library(ggplot2)

# Create the boxplot
plot <- ggplot(ex1, aes(x = Sample, y = DeltaCt, fill = Sample)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(
    title = "ΔCt Distribution by Group",
    x = "Sample Group",
    y = "ΔCt"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

# Display the plot
print(plot)

# Save the plot as a PNG file
ggsave("qpcr_delta_ct_boxplot.png", plot = plot, width = 8, height = 6, dpi = 300)

```
